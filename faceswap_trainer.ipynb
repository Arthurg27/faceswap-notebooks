        "\n",
        "**Description:**\n",
        "\n",
        "This is a jupyter notebook for training faceswap models on Google Colaboratory or colab. You will get a NVIDIA K80 GPU with 12GB of VRAM available for traning. It's advised that you use an external storage to store your models like Google Drive so you don't loose your work if something happens to the colab instance. You should have the traning image files on the colab machine to avoid network syncing. The instructions are based on my personal workflow but you can change where or how you save and load your data.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Instruction:**\n",
        "\n",
        "You should check that your instance has a GPU available. \n",
        "\n",
        "*   Go to top menu Runtime -> Change runtime type -> set Python3 and GPU\n",
        "*   When done run the GPU status notebook to check GPU information\n",
        "\n",
        "In the import packages section, uncomment the version of faceswap you would like to add. The first one is the latest faceswap code others are there for legacy reasons, version we know that work. \n",
        "\n",
        "Connect your Google Drive with the colab, this will mount your Google Drive to folder Drive, it will act as a local folder\n",
        "\n",
        "Alternativly you can upload images and models in zip files. Image set should be named set.zip and models models.zip. Run a cell and then browse the appropriate zip file.\n",
        "\n",
        "Run the first cell in the faceswap traning section, that would initialize the image preview python functions\n",
        "\n",
        "Run train compand with appopriate params:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "*   -A - face A folder\n",
        "*   -B - face B folder\n",
        "*   -m - model path\n",
        "*   -t - model type name, trainers: original, dfaker, dfl_h128, iae, unblanced, villain\n",
        "*   -bs - batch size, use an approprite batch size based on what are you trying to achive and the available GPU memory\n",
        "*   -s - save interavl, detemines how often does the model save and updates the preview window. Syncing with cloud storage can be slow with large models\n",
        "\n",
        "If you are an advanced user, you can view the tran config ini file by runing the cell under traning. Cell under that one will update the config file with the cell contents\n",
        "\n",
        "To end traning press the stop icon once, that will start the end process. Wait for the model to save after that the cell will stop executing\n",
        "\n",
        "**Notes:**\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "*    Colab instance will shutdown after 12hours\n",
        "*    If you get an error no GPU available try again later\n",
        "*    You can shutdown the browser when executing a script after about an hour without the browser the notebook will terminate\n",
        "*    If saving to Google Drive you have to monitor the amount of free space on the drive, every save cycle it will send prevous model to the trash. If the space fills up the last save is going to get corrupted. The training will break and a model from the trash will have be restored \n",
        "*    You can run only 1 cell at a time\n"
